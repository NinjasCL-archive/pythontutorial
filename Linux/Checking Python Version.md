# Checking If Python is Installed

If you are using some Linux flavour, there is a 99.99% chance that you already have Python already installed.

First, know what version do you have with (run it inside a terminal)

	$ python --version

if you got something like

	Python 2.7.2+


Congratulations, you have Python in your System, YAAAAAY!!!.
